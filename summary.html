<h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top:4.5%"> The Narrative of the Quest</h1>
<p>
My research endeavours and interests have been primarily driven by my curiosities about the multiple facets of social cognition (its evolution, persistence, manifestation and consequences), with a special interest in understanding the origins and dynamics of varying within-group, between-group, interpersonal attitudes and actions in differing sociocultural and economic settings. 
<br>Hailing from an increasingly polarised country and world, questions of the order or - 'what does the boundary-conditions of cooperation lie' in that, -where does cooperation/altruism/empathy/kindness end and discrimination/prejudice/apathy/hatred begin and vice-versa -where does self end and other begin - and how does all the dynamics interplay - have provoked my thought. 
<br>I have been attempting to explore them through interdisciplinary approach lenses of:
<br>1) investigating the effects of the perceptual generalisation of salient social prioritisation (say, of self vs other) to a group-level effect, not only with primitive perceptual-judgement, working memory or attentional blink tasks but also with more complex response differences like in an Approach-Avoidance paradigm (attempting bayesian modelling of the same); 
<br>or that of (2) agent-based computational model simulating an explorer-exploiter society to tease factors that may incentivise the natural selection of higher community cooperation in competitive societies; or that of 
<br> 3) in collaborative work with Dr Krupenye at JHU, I am also looking into the lenses of comparative cognition to analyse (with logits and conditional logits) the patterns of cooperation network and coalition formation as solicited by our closest primates during conflicts.
<br>Additionally, looking at atypical situations is an approach that I have found to be fascinating in understanding the possible dynamics of the evolution of social cognition and our situated behaviours. 
<br>Thus I have been working with schizophrenic patients to compare their response patterns to self-associated stimuli with that of neurotypical participants, and on the way to developing a sensory-substitution device that would convert socio-environmental sounds (like important instructions) into vibrotactile feedback stimuli, I have also been learning insights on how social stimuli are processed differently by differing kinds of perceiver populations.
<br>A few other studies like that on longitudinal responses to the Sense of Agency Scale for COVID-affected populace or a short eye-tracking study attempting to check the attention spans in internet naive populace have also taken shape later in pursuit of testing how our understanding of cognition should be context-dependent.
<br>In my first stint as a summer research fellow at the Indian Academy of Sciences, I attempted to develop a computation model of the Mirror Neuron-like ANN System that would learn a model of motor planning (through attempting emulation of an observed action execution) for one's 'self' through actively observing the 'other'. It is this affinity towards looking at our cognition reactive to the regular world that had also given me an interest in public policy and how science should inform it for improved outcomes for all. Thus, I worked as a research intern with NITI Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India during one of my undergraduate winters tracing the common factors between developed and developing economies. This last year, while professionally employed as a Research Analyst with the Indian Political Action Committee as the State Team Lead of their Strategic Research & Insight unit last year, I actively engaged in and thus gained a very valuable first-hand appreciation of the study and application of voter's social choice and insights, develop and inform influential policy interventions that would positively actively affect the lives and democratic choices of the people, and encourage their participation in an inclusive electorate system away from polarising or communal sentiments (mostly propagated by and through the online algorithms) and more towards welfare goals, as was reflected in the consequential and historic 2021 Legislative Assembly election of my home state of West Bengal, India.
