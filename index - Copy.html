<h3 style="margin-left:5%">About my Self and its many delusions</h3>
<div style="margin-left:5%">
<p> Initially, I had indeeed momentarily thought of traversing from Sagan to Nietzche through Sartre to put some profound quotes in the pretense of describing myself. :P<br> but I have now long come to terms with the holistic futility of any existence in the grander scheme of everything in this universe that I have tried to study. <br> but since it's still necessary...<br>
<p> My confusion with my own existence had gifted me a place at the <a href="iitk.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</a> as an MS(by Research) student at their <a href= https://www.cgs.iitk.ac.in/ target="_blank">Cognitive Science</a> program.<br> I wont be able to put into words the experience it has been.</p>
<p> I had my undergraduate training as a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering graduate from <a href="http://www.heritageit.edu/" target="_blank">Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata</a>.<br>The best I can say about it is that even in the haystack, I fortunately had stumbled upon some of the most extraordinary things and beings, who I think have changed everything for whom I am, the little I am, today. </p>
<p> Probably I define myself by putting out in my first breath that I didn't have a good home. But I got to experience atleast the taste of a better childhood and adolescence (Grades 1 to 12) at my second home, <a href=http://www.southpoint.edu.in/ target="_blank">South Point High School, Kolkata</a></p>
