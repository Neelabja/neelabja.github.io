<p>
Understanding social cognition in its all-encompassing magnificence has been, and is becoming is my ultimate goal of pursuit, not only in traditional academic exercise, but also from a philosophical and translationally implimentable angle as well.

<p> It would have been impossible without the wonderful people who have directly shaped me in that endeavour. This space, is just to acknowledge them.

<p> Firstly, my current mentors cum collaborators for my ongoing projects, namely

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
<br>->my life-changing guide in the wisdom of <a href="https://iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick"> Dr Harish Karnick</a>, who taught me that one is never too odd or too wayward to question anything;
<br>->the patience of gifting the space of learning as have been endowed to me by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/langcoglabiitk/team/dr-ark-verma"> Dr Ark Verma</a>- continues to enrich me till this day <br>the latter two acting ever so kindly and wisely as my Masters thesis supervisors, especially through the stressors of a pandemic.
<br>->A newer window into application-work was provided by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pragathipriyadharsini/">Dr Pragathi Priyadarshani </a> who made me a part of her translational neuroscience applications.
<p>It has been my greatest break to have been able to learn from all 3 of them (the latest mentioned ones above) during my stints as a student and researcher at the Department of Cognitive Science, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

<p> Currently, I am also enjoying a chance of studying with non-normative patients with Dr. Chithra U (PhD Candidate under <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=kXcyZ_sAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr Urvaksh Mehta</a>) at the National Institute of Mental Health and NeuroSciences, India.
<br> Apart from that, the past few months have involved a lot of further learning exercises while collaborating with my peers, Anjoom Thahir, Kshitij Kumar, and likewise.

<p>Previously, I had learnt the scientific approach, for the first time from <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/nsyslabcncs/research?authuser=0> Dr Joby Joseph</a>,  Centre for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, Univ. of Hyderabad.
<p>My friends-cum-collaborators during my Masters, Aastha, Akshay, Rithwik, Oviya, Harish, Abhirup has also immensely endowed my research.
